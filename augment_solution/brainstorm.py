# DR MOLLOY SUGGESTIONS FOR AUGMENTING APPROX SOLUTION
# FOR MIN GRAPH COLORING NP PROJECT

# lower bound, papers about lower bounding, 
# lower bound (doesn't hve to be the best lower bound), 
# compare approximation, show how they differ, 
# discuss how they differ, max clique = min color, 
# talk about how they're related, max clique and min color are the same problem, 
# generate a bunch of test cases how long to break approximation algorithm, 
# exact solution should run in a reasonably amount of time, 
# run two programs (exact/approx) are they the same? are they different? 
# generate test cases/generate graphs, run the other two programs, 
# google around for np complete min graph coloring to solve 3sat (reduction)
