# IDEAS FOR EXACT SOLUTION
# Find every possible coloring of the graph regardless of if it is correct or not
# Bounds for coloring will be 1 to n where n is the number of vertices
# Sift through all possible colorings and check if they are valid using 2 loops?
# If valid, check if it is the minimum coloring
# If it is, store it and continue checking for other colorings
# If it is not, continue checking for other colorings
# Return the minimum coloring found
